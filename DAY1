var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined , let and const variables are not initialized.
  Example-
                   1.var a=2;
                    2.{
                               Let a=2;
                         }
                    3. const a=4;

   JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:
var length = 16;                               // Number
var lastName = "Johnson";                      // String
var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object
//boolean
var x = 5;
var y = 5;
var z = 6;
(x == y)       // Returns true
(x == z)       // Returns false
